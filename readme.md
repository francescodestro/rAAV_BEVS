# Mechanistic model for rAAV manufacturing in the baculovirus expression vector system 

v1: batch model (synchronous infection, up to two waves) for TwoBac (Smith et al., 2009) and ThreeBac (Urabe et al., 2002) systems. The model simulates baculovirus binding, baculovirus transport to nucleus and replication, release of budded baculovirus, transcription and translation of AAV genes, rAAV capsid formation, Rep protein synthesis, transgene rescue and amplification, and transgene encapsidation.

Files:
- `run_simulation.m`: external wrapper to be used for setting inputs and running simulation
- `BEVS_simulation.m`: function called by external wrapper to run simulation
- `BEVS_parameters.m`: function containing model parameters
- `BEVS_model.m`: function containing model equations

Input: 
- System type (TwoBac/ThreeBac)
- Cell density at time of infection
- Multiplicity of infection
- Simulation duration

Output: 
- State vector at time intervals of 0.1 h

## State vector legend
The legend of the state vector for TwoBac and ThreeBac simulations follows. The indexing of the state vector is organized in modules consistent between TwoBac and ThreeBac, to access the variables in the output array more easily. As a result, several entries of the state vector are null, especially for TwoBac. More computationally efficient implementations can be developed, with a more complex indexing of the state vector.

Index `j` refers to: <br>
`j=1`: cells infected by repcapBV <br>
`j=3`: cells infected by goiBV <br>
`j=5`: cells infected by repcapBV and goiBV <br>

<strong> Cells concentration </strong>  <br>
<br>
`x(1)` = uninfected viable cells density (#/mL) <br>
`x(4+j)`= concentration of viable j - first wave [#/mL]  <br>
`x(28+(j-1)*22)` = concentration of nonviable j - first wave [#/mL]

<br>
